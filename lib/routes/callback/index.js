/**
 * Allows users to request a callback from a Contact Tracer. If accepted, the request is added to the
 * AWS callback queue with information about the user to call. The user's phone # is submitted as
 * part of this request, but the phone # IS NOT stored with the user's database record. It is included
 * in the body of the AWS callback queue message so that Contact Tracers know which number to call.
 *
 * NOTE: Within the AWS callback queue the user's ID and phone # are stored together. This is a
 * potential PII issue as it provides an identifiable mapping between users and their phone numbers.
 * While the expected implementation of the code reading off that AWS callback queue would not store
 * the user's ID and phone # in any additional system, that the items are put into the queue
 * together leaves open the possibility for PII/GDPR issues.
 *
 * See schema.js/callback for details on what data can be submitted with this request.
 *
 * Users are identified by the 'id' in the claims of the request Authorization JWT header. The id value
 * comes from the registration that occurred when the user installed the application.
 *
 * When the request comes in the user's registration record will be updated setting the last_callback
 * column to the current timestamp if and only if the last_callback column is empty. This prevents the
 * same user from entering multiple callback requests.
 *
 * Users will be allowed to request additional callbacks if and only if some other process clears the
 * last_callback cell in the user's record. It will be up to each region to decide if they want to
 * allow subsequent callback requests. If they choose to support that then clearing the last_callback
 * cell will allow a subsequent callback request from the user.
 *
 * All requests go through authentication which means both the user and device will be verified. This
 * process will prevent random people from submitting callback requests. Theoretically, only the app
 * can make this call.
 *
 * Responses:
 *  204: The callback request was successfully accepted and written to the database
 *  429: User has already requested a callback, and depending on the region rules, there is an existing
 *    unfulfilled callback for the user
